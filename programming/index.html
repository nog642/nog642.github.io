			<h2>Languages</h2>
			<h3>HTML</h3>
			<p>
				I know <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML">HTML</a> isn't technically a programming language, but it is coding, so I'm going to put it here anyways. I learned some HTML when I was very young (around 5-7 years old) from my dad, who helped me make a website for myself. It was horribly designed, with a bright <a target="_blank" href="../images/0000ff.png">#0000FF</a> background and ugly Times New Roman font, but at least I got the concept of tags and attributes.
			</p>
			<p>
				Later, in 6th grade, I took a semester-long class called Digital Technology 1, where one of our assignments was to make a website. This one was a bit less terrible than the other one, and it was not very complete, but I got a refresher in HTML. Unlike the last website, where my dad did most of the coding, this time I did all of the work, and was able to do HTML myself. It was a bit better than the last one, with the background being light grey instead of bright blue. The font was still Times New Roman though, and the layout was actually worse.
			</p>
			<p>
				The next year, when I was in 7th grade, I took Digital Technology 2, in which we were told to make a website again. This time, after using inspect element on the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.google.com/">Google homepage</a>, I found out about divs. I did some research, and learned about that and CSS. The website I made that time was much better than the previous two websites, I had a grey background with a very light grey box in the center, which contained all the text and a top menu. The box had a 1 px border, and the corners were rounded. Overall, it still looked pretty bad, but it was getting better. I tried to do a tutorial on jQuery, and one of my classmates made his menu in jQuery, but I didn't finish the tutorial.
			</p>
			<p>
				In 8th grade, I took another semester-long class called Media Technology. Again, we had the assignment of making a website. I made the theme a bit darker than the last one, and got rid of the ugly box. I used CSS to make my top menu dropdown with many options. It was a big improvement, but similar to the other two years at school, most of the pages were empty because we had nothing to put there. This time, we put many of the projects we worked on there, but we didn't get all the way through what the teacher had planned at the beginning, so many of the pages were empty.
			</p>
			<p>
				Near the end of 8th grade, my friend <a target="_blank" href="http://imyxh.github.io/">Ian Huang</a> made a style guide called <a target="_blank" href="http://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1p57vOAu8mz-R8rsEEGfgDxW9jKqEK-9m76hOMOZ8StI/edit">Orbit</a>, and I decided to use it to make a website. Most of it was pretty easy, though I had to fiddle with the jQuery a lot to make the sidebar since I had never used jQuery before, and the final product was the website you're on now. Although what I really made was a website <i>template</i>, which Ian and I also reused for our <a target="_blank" href="http://imyxh.github.io/bio-concept-map/">biology project</a>.
			</p>
			<h3>MATLAB</h3>
			<p>
				My dad taught me some <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MATLAB">MATLAB</a> when I was very young (5-7 years old, like HTML), and it was the first real programming language I learned. It introduced me to for loops, while loops, if statements, how to use variables properly, keeping indexes, arrays, and all that. Most of the programs I wrote, I was helped by my dad, and he did most of the work. By the end though, I understood it quite well and could probably write a relatively simple program from start to finish. I haven't touched MATLAB in years though, and I've forgotten the syntax since then.
			</p>
			<h3>JavaScript</h3>
			<p>
				In 2015, when I was in 7th grade, I was taking Digital Technology 2. One of our assignments was to go on <a target="_blank" href="http://www.codecademy.com/">codecademy</a> and take a tutorial in either JavaScript, Python, or Ruby. I chose to do JavaScript. Before this, the only real programming experience I had had was with MATLAB. Since I already had some programming background, learning JavaScript was relatively easy, and it was great after I had learned it. It was much more versatile than MATLAB, and I could make things that could run in a web browser. This was the first time I was able to make proper programs from beginning to end by myself.
			</p>
			<h3>Python</h3>
			<p>
				At first, since I chose to do a JavaScript tutorial instead of a <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_(programming_language)">Python</a> one in 7th grade, I held that JavaScript was better, and I didn't want to learn Python. However, when I did my <a target="_blank" href="http://databrigade.com/recent-graduates/hands-on-ml-program/">internship</a> at <a target="_blank" href="http://lightsphereai.com/">Lightsphere AI</a>, I had to learn it. Since the only other programming languages I had used were MATLAB and JavaScript, I didn't know what to expect. When I learned JavaScript, it was quite different from MATLAB. When I learned Python however, I was surprised by how similar it was to JavaScript&mdash;they could pretty much be translated one-to-one, line-by-line. In fact that's exactly what I did. To get a bit of practice with Python before I started any real projects, I converted my Vigen&egrave;re cipher program, which I had written in JavaScript, to Python. After using Python for the majority of my work at Lightsphere AI, it's currently my strongest language.
			</p>
			<h3>Java</h3>
			<p>
				<a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_(programming_language)">Java</a> is the language I learned most recently. In mid-2016, I decided it was time for me to learn a new programming language. Java seemed the most reasonable option, since it was used very commonly. I started taking the Java tutorial on <a target="_blank" href="http://www.codecademy.com/">codecademy</a>, and was pretty surprised. I thought it would be similar to JavaScript, or at least more similar than Python, but not at all. Python and JavaScript are much closer to eachother than to Java. I found out about static typing, which still seems like quite a limitation. I didn't finish the tutorial though, and forgot about it for a while.
			</p>
			<p>
				During winter break of my freshman year of high school, I had an opportunity to earn some money doing work for Lightsphere AI. To fit in with the rest of the backend code though, I had to write my program in Java. I tried to finish the Java tutorial on codecademy, but quickly found that it wasn't proving very useful. Instead, I learned Java the natural way&mdash;just going at it, and looking stuff up on Google whenever necessary, usually clicking a link to <a target="_blank" href="http://stackoverflow.com/">stack overflow</a>. I had already done some work with classes in Python, but only after having written a program in Java did I truly understand its object oriented nature.
			</p>
			<h2>Vigen&egrave;re Cipher</h2>
			<p>
				The <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vigen%C3%A8re_cipher">Vigen&egrave;re cipher</a> is a cipher from the 1500s that was extremely effective, and is still pretty hard for professional cryptologists to crack sometimes. It uses a keyword of any length containing only letters, and uses it to encrypt a text. Each letter of the text is replaced with a different letter based on the original letter and the key.
			</p>
			<p>
				A Caesar cipher is a more primitive type of cipher, as you can probably tell by its name. It was around since way before the 1500s, and is easier to crack. The key is just a number from 0 to 25, which can also be represented with the letters <code>a</code> through <code>z</code>. To encode it, you shift each letter of the plaintext through the aphabet by the number of the key. If you reach the end of the alphabet, you loop around.
			</p>
			<table cellspacing="5px">
				<tr>
					<td>
						<div id="text">Plaintext:</div>
					</td>
					<td>
						<code>THIS IS AN EXAMPLE</code>
					</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>
						<div id="text">Key:</div>
					</td>
					<td>
						<code>DDDD DD DD DDDDDDD</code>
					</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>
						<div id="text">Ciphertext:</div>
					</td>
					<td>
						<code>WKLV LV DQ HADPSOH</code>
					</td>
				</tr>
			</table>
			<p>
				In this example, each letter in the plaintext is shifted by 4, because the key is <code>D</code>. <code>T</code> becomes <code>W</code> because <code>W</code> is 4 letters after <code>T</code> in the alphabet. However, you can see some patterns here. <code>THIS IS</code> becomes <code>WKLV LV</code>. There is a repetition, and it is clear that the two words end with the same 2 letters, which can help in decoding. In the Vigen&egrave;re cipher, instead of using just one letter as the key for every letter in the plaintext, a keyword is taken and repeated instead, and a different Caesar cipher is applied to each letter of the plaintext. For example, if the keyword was <code>DUCK</code>, the <code>T</code> in <code>THIS</code> would become a <code>W</code>, because <code>W</code> is 4 (<code>D</code>) letters after <code>T</code> in the alphabet, and the <code>H</code> in <code>THIS</code> becomes a <code>B</code> because <code>B</code> is 21 (<code>U</code>) letters after <code>H</code> in the alphabet (if you loop around).
			</p>

						<div id="text">Plaintext:</div>

						<div id="text">Key:</div>

					<td>
						<code>DUCK DU CK DUCKDUC</code>

				The original version of this was made on <a target="_blank" href="http://www.codecademy.com/">codecademy</a> in JavaScript, and can be found <a target="_blank" href="https://www.codecademy.com/nog642/codebits/dUcSc9">here</a>. I also rewrote this in Python as an exercise while I was learning it, but the version embedded here is in JS, since that's built for the web.
